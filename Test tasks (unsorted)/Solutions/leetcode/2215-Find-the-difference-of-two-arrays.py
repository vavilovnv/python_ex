Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of
size 2 where:
answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2.
answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1.

Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.

class Solution:
    def findDifference(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        s1, s2 = set(nums1), set(nums2)
        return [list(s1 - s2), list(s2 - s1)]

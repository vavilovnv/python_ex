Category - Medium

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in
non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific
target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2]
where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an
integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not
use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

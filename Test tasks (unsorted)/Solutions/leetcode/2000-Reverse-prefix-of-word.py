Category - Easy

Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word
that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch
(inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the
segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will
be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.
